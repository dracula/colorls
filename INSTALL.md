#### Activating theme

1. First you need to have installed [colorls](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls#installation). Ensure you are running the latest release of colorls, as support for hex string values were added as of the [1.4.2 release](https://github.com/athityakumar/colorls/releases/tag/v1.4.2)


2. (Optionally) Make a backup of your current dark colorscheme:

    ```bash
    mv ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml.backup
    ```
3. Copy the [`dark_colors.yaml`](https://github.com/dracula/colorls/blob/master/dark_colors.yaml) file to the dark color scheme location for colorls:

    ```bash
    cp dark_colors.yaml ~/.config/colorls/dark_colors.yaml
    ```
4. Use the `--dark` option when utilizing `colorls`:

    ```bash
    colorls --dark
    # Additionally: alias ls="colorls --dark"
    # or, perhaps more sanely: alias cls="colorls --dark"
    ```
